      <p class="about-us-text">
        The Barangay Information System is designed to bring the services of the barangay closer to the community in a modern and efficient way. It transforms traditional record-keeping and manual processes into a centralized digital platform where residents can easily access information, submit requests, and connect with barangay services. Through this system, the barangay ensures transparency, accessibility, and convenience, creating a bridge between local officials and residents. More than just a portal, it is a reflection of the community’s commitment to progress, unity, and service for every citizen.

The CSS below is identical to the last one provided, ensuring the Secretary, Treasurer, and SK Chairman sections are correctly spaced and aligned by removing the problematic `padding-bottom` from `.other-official-card`. It also includes the necessary CSS to center the 7th Kagawad card.

```css
<style scoped>
/* You might need to add or adjust styles for the actual image within the photo box */

</style>
